### Goal

- Use the unsupervised method proposed in ___ for the clasiffication problem in MNIST
  The figure below shows the results from adapting the code with the resnet18 architecture using the loss function proposed in [1] and compare with the performance from using an encoder-decoder architecture.
  
  As the loss in both problems is different we use the accuracy that used kNN for measuring the classification. As is shown the performance obtained by resnet18 is way better than the one achieved only by the encoder-decoder with the enconder suggested architecture.

- Propose a Encoder-Decoder Architecture so MNIST images can be reconstructed
