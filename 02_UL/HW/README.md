### Goal

- Use the unsupervised method proposed in ___ for the clasiffication problem in MNIST
  The figure below shows the results from adapting the code with the resnet18 architecture using the loss function proposed in [1] and compare with the performance from using an encoder-decoder architecture.
  As the loss in both problems is different we use the accuracy that used kNN for measuring the classification.

- Propose a Encoder-Decoder Architecture so MNIST images can be reconstructed
